In the project, Arduino Uno is acting as brain, it contains the 
program which is used to run the 16*2 LCD screen (each 
character is displayed in a 5×7pixel matrix), Relays ,Relay Driver 
and miniature the transmission line(Each phase line R,Y,B is 
represented by 4*117Ω resistor, the ϐirst resistor represents 
7km and 2nd resistor represents 8km and 3rd resistor represent 
9km ). The relay is protected by diode. And the relay continuous 
ly switches for ϐinding the fault in the transmission line and 
relay driver is used for the ampliϐication of current . There is a 
senor wire connected to A0 pin of the Arduino for the fault 
detection.
